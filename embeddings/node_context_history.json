        "content": "**What it is and its primary purpose**\n\nThe `Webinar` class represents a webinar entity in an application. Its primary purpose is to store and manage information about webinars, including their details, attendees, and categories.\n\n**Visible fields, methods, and annotations**\n\n* Fields:\n\t+ `webinarId`: the unique identifier of the webinar\n\t+ `webinarName`: the name of the webinar\n\t+ `dateTime`: the date and time of the webinar\n\t+ `duration`: the duration of the webinar (annotated with `@Convert` to specify a custom converter)\n\t+ `lecturer`: the user who is lecturing the webinar (annotated with `@ManyToOne`)\n\t+ `classroom`: the classroom where the webinar is held (annotated with `@ManyToOne`)\n\t+ `students`: a set of users enrolled in the webinar (annotated with `@ManyToMany`)\n\t+ `categories`: a set of categories associated with the webinar (annotated with `@ManyToMany`)\n\t+ `maxCapacity`: the maximum capacity of the webinar\n* Methods:\n\t+ Constructors: two constructors, one with parameters and one without\n\t+ Getters for each field\n\t+ Setters for each field\n\t+ `enrollStudent(User student)`: adds a user to the set of students enrolled in the webinar\n\t+ `unenrollStudent(User student)`: removes a user from the set of students enrolled in the webinar\n\t+ `addCategory(Category category)`: adds a category to the set of categories associated with the webinar\n\t+ `removeCategory(Category category)`: removes a category from the set of categories associated with the webinar\n* Annotations:\n\t+ `@Entity` indicates that this class is an entity in the application's persistence layer\n\t+ `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue` specify that the `webinarId` field is the primary key and should be automatically generated\n\t+ `@Convert` specifies a custom converter for the `duration` field\n\n**Structure and key characteristics**\n\nThe `Webinar` class has a simple structure, with fields representing the various attributes of a webinar. The class also includes methods to manage these attributes, such as adding and removing students and categories. The use of annotations indicates that this class is part of an application's persistence layer, likely using JPA (Java Persistence API) for database interactions.",
