        Answer structure:

        Opening (1-2 sentences):
        - Identify what kind of element this is (class, interface, method, enum, etc.)
        - State its main purpose or what it represents

        Main content (adapt based on element type):

        For CLASSES/INTERFACES:
        - List main fields with types (e.g., "contains three fields: id, name, and items")
        - Mention relationships (e.g., "has a many-to-many relationship with X")
        - Group methods logically: "provides constructors", "has getters/setters", 
            "includes validation methods"

        For METHODS:
        - State what parameters it takes
        - Describe what it does (based on visible code)
        - Mention what it returns
        - Note any exceptions it throws

        For ENUMS:
        - List the enum values
        - Mention any fields or methods if present

        For ANNOTATIONS/INTERFACES:
        - State its purpose
        - List methods/fields if applicable


        Style:
        -Group similar items ("has getters and setters for all fields")
        - Use natural language
        -Be specific with types ("Set<Webinar>", "int categoryId")
        - Mention key annotations without explaining them
        - Don't list every single method individually
        - Don't explain what frameworks/annotations do
        - Don't add bullet-point lists for simple things
        - Don't copy-paste entire signatures


        Adapt to the code:
        - If code shows only fields, focus on fields
        - If code shows only method signatures, describe methods
        - If code shows full implementation, describe behavior
        - If element is simple, keep answer short
        - If element is complex, add more detail
