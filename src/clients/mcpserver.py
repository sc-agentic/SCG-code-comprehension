    #REMINDER: IF YOU HAVE CONTEXT (CODE) OF NODE FROM ANOTHER QUERY AND YOU CAN GIVE ANSWER DO NOT ASK ANOTHER QUESTION.
    Retrieves code and context for specific classes, methods, interfaces, etc...,
    **If user asks about parameter or variable ask him to specify which method/class/interface it belongs to.**

    **When to use:**
    Question contains specific names of code elements (classes, methods, functions, variables, constructors).
    - Question contains a proper name: "LoginController", "authenticate", "userRepository" and type: CLASS,METHOD etc. If
      type is missing you can try to guess it based on
      whole conversation and name of node
    - Question asks: "Describe class X", "What does method Y do?", "What fields does class Z have?"
    - You want to find a specific element by name

    **HOW BACKEND WORKS:**
    - Inside server node is retrieved from vector base by string of `KIND NAME` and that is achieved by parameter `pairs`
    - User asks about specific **variable**, **parameter** or **value** ask him to specify which **METHOD/CLASS/INTERFACE** it belongs to. Data about parameters, variables and values is not stored in vector base.

    **Parameters:**
    ```json
    {
      "question": "exact user question",
      "pairs": [["kind1", "name1"], ["kind2", "name2"]],
      "top_k": 3-5,
      "max_neighbors": 1-8,
      "neighbor_types": ["CLASS|METHOD|CONSTRUCTOR|INTERFACE|ENUM|OBJECT|TYPE|TYPE_PARAMETER|ANY"]
    }
    ```

    **Parameters values selection:**

    - `pairs:`
      - Extract from user's question pairs (kind, name) for each entity mentioned in it. If there are mistakes in spelling - fix it.
      - Example: "Describe User Class" -> pairs = [["CLASS", "User"]]
      - Example: "Describe User class and Category class" -> pairs = [["CLASS", "User"], ["CLASS", "Category"]]

    - `max_neighbors:`
      - Simple question ("Describe class X") → **1-2**
      - Medium question ("Where is class X used?") → **3-5**
      - Complex question ("What are all dependencies of class X?") → **6-8**

    - `neighbor_types:` - specifies the list of **TYPES OF NEIGHBOR NODES** to fetch based on user question.

        Available options are: CLASS,METHOD,CONSTRUCTOR,INTERFACE,ENUM,OBJECT,TYPE,TYPE_PARAMETER,ANY

        - Question: "Describe User class" - `neighbor_types` not specified in question so go with ["ANY"]
        - Question: "Describe User class and 2 most important classes related to it" - `neighbor_types` is specified and it
          is ["CLASS"]
        - Question: "Where is class X used?" - `neighor_type` not specified - go with ["ANY"]
        - Question: "Desctibe User class and most imporatant methods and classes conntected to it" -> set `neighbor_type`

    4. **Suggest, Don't Act:** - If you think more neighbors are needed, **ASK THE USER FIRST** in your text response.
       - *Example:* "I have analyzed `ContextWaiter`. It connects to `ReentrantLock`. Would you like me to fetch the code for `ReentrantLock` next?"

    Query for RANKINGS, TOP-N elements, largest/smallest values in code.

    **When to use:**
    Question is about ranking, top-N elements, largest/smalles values.
    - Question contains: "top", "largest", "smallest", etc.
    - User asks about ordered list

    **HOW BACKEND WORKS:**
    - For `list_only` returns only list of selected nodes with `kind`, `uri` and `metric`.
    - For `full_desc` return code of selected nodes.

    **Examples:**

    - "What are 5 classes with the most lines of code?"
    - "Top 3 functions with the most neighbors"
    - "Describe 5 most important classes"
    - "Describe 5 most important elements"

    **Parameters values selection:**

    - `query_mode:`

        - `"list_only"` — ranking only without detailed descriptions
        - `"full_desc"` — ranking with full description of each element

        **Do not user `null`, empty string or other values**. Always choose one of two available modes.

    - `kinds:`

        `kinds` specifiecs the list of **TYPES OF NODES** to fetch based on user question.

        Available options are: CLASS,METHOD,VARIABLE,CONSTRUCTOR,ANY.

        - **HOW TO CHOOSE**:
          - Question: "What are 5 most important classes" - `kinds` specified in question so go with ["CLASS"]
          - Question: "What are all entities with none neighbors" - `kinds` is not specified so go with ["ANY"]
          - Question: "What are 5 most important classes or methods?" - `kinds` is specified - go with ["CLASS", "METHOD"]
          - Unsure what to choose - choose ["ANY"]


    - `metric:`
        `metric` specifiecs the metric user wants to filter nodes with.

        Available metrics are:
            - loc - (lines of code),
            - pagerank - importance based on the quantity and quality of links pointing to them
            - katz - measures a node's influence in a network by summing its direct and indirect connections, assigning a diminishing weight to longer paths, meaning immediate neighbors matter more than distant ones.
            - eigenvector - connection to most important entities
            - in_degree - number of ingoing edges
            - out_degree - number of outgoing edges
            - combined - combined metric, most important entities
            - number_of_neighbors - number of related entities'

         - **HOW TO CHOOSE**:
          - Question: "What are 5 most important classes" - `metric` is not specified in question so go with "combined"
          - Question: "What are all entities with none neighbors" - `metric` is specified so go with "number_of_neighbors"
          - Question: "What are 5 classes with most lines of code?" - `metric` is specified - go with "combined"
          - Unsure what to choose - choose "combined"

    - `limit:`
        `limit` specifies how many nodes to fetch based on user question.

        - **HOW TO CHOOSE**:
            - "all", "everything", "wszystkie" or something like that is in question -> "limit" = "all"
            - If the question contains a number connected to number of nodes -> "limit" = that number

    - `exact_metric_value:`
        `exact_metric_value specifies value of node metrics that needs to be fetched.

        - **HOW TO CHOOSE**:
            - If limit = "all" AND user explicitly mentions a metric value (example: "with none neighbors", "with 0 neighbors", "with 0 lines of code") → metric_value = that value
                -Treat words like "none", "no", "without", "brak" as 0
            - Otherwise → metric_value = 0

    - `order:`
        `order` specifies order in which list of nodes is sorted

        - **HOW TO CHOOSE**:
           - If question contains words like "biggest", "largest", "most", "max" → use "desc"
           - If question contains words like "smallest", "least", "min" → use "asc"

      - possible values: **CLASS**, **METHOD**, **INTERFACE**, **ENUM**, **TYPE_PARAMETER**, **OBJECT**, **TYPE**
    - `keywords` - based on question choose 10 keywords that should be included in nodes names in Java or Scala
